                <p>Established in 1985, Zack Germain is a (former) musician who grew up outside of Charleston, South Carolina. Zack wandered through various higher education institutions in his late teens and most of his twenties, starting with a Bachelors of Music Composition at Furman University in Greenville, SC. Convinced that music was the “next big thing”, Zack continued his education at Florida State University with a Masters in Music Theory where he theorized many theories about music. This proved to be a foolhardy endeavor, so he pivoted into another Masters in Business Administration at the University of Cincinnati. It was here that he learned the terrifying reality of Skyline Chili ©, a local delicacy of sweetened meat sauce glopped upon cold spaghetti.</p> 

                <p>With thousands of dollars of debt amassed, Zack decided it was time to enter the “real world” he had heard oh so many rumors about. This led him to Chicago, the home of improv comedy, constant political strife, and soggy meat sandwiches. Having spent his life moving from one school to another, Zack landed a job at Northwestern University where he has worked ever since. He hopes that knowledge from the coding bootcamp can be parlayed into entering the “real-real world” outside of the university system.
